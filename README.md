# Movie Data Analysis: Correlation with Gross Revenue 🎬📊  

## Overview  
This project analyzes a **Movie Database** from **Kaggle**, focusing on understanding what factors correlate the most with a movie's **gross revenue**. The analysis was performed using **Python in a Jupyter Notebook**.  

## Project Workflow  
1. **Dataset Source:** Imported a movie dataset from **Kaggle**.  
2. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handled missing values.  
   - Removed duplicates.  
   - Standardized column formats.  
3. **Feature Selection:** Identified key variables such as **budget, runtime, genre, director, and cast**.  
4. **Correlation Analysis:**  
   - Created a **correlation matrix** to explore relationships between variables.  
   - Determined which factors have the highest impact on **gross revenue**.  
5. **Visualization & Insights:**  
   - Used **Seaborn and Matplotlib** to create heatmaps and scatter plots.  
   - Interpreted the results to identify trends in **box office performance**.
